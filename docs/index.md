# Welcome to MasterMind's documentation

MasterMind is a management platform for FIWARE Data and IoT services, such as
Context Brokers, IoT Agents, IoT Managers and so forth. It allows users to
create individual projects with defined permissions per user, register Docker
Swarm clusters to them in order to deploy or register IoT services, as well as
registering and managing NSGI subscriptions.

Users can deploy Services from a Catalog of available recipes, as well as import
their own recipes for use in individual Projects within MasterMind.

The Github README.md file contains a summary of how to deploy MasterMind. For a
more in depth explanation of its features, as well as installation and
configuration, see the User Manual and Admin Manual.
