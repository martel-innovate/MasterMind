# Step by Step guide

## Logging in

Assuming MasterMind is running locally, the home page can be reached on
<http://localhost:8080>. The first time accessing MasterMind the user will most
likely see a welcome page.

![welcome Page](../images/home.png)

Clicking Login will allow the user to Authenticate in MasterMind with its Fiware
Lab credentials. After successfully logging in, the user can access the Projects
page.

## Registering a new Project

The user can create a new project on this page by clicking the "register
project" button below. When creating a new project the user will be asked to
name it and provide a short description. Once the project is created the user is
automatically given an Admin role in it.

When clicking on the newly created project, the user will be brought to the
project overview page.

## Registering a Cluster

Before any services can be deployed, a Cluster needs to be registered first.
From the Project overview page, clicking on Clusters will lead the User to the
Clusters overview page. Clicking "Register Cluster" will bring up the form to
register a Cluster.

![cluster registration page](../images/cluster_registration.png)

We can assume that the user already has a Docker Swarm Cluster available, and
also has access to the TLS files for it (cert.pem, ca.pem and key.pem files).

The form has to be filled with this data:

- The name for the Cluster
- A description for the Cluster
- The endpoint of the Cluster. This refers specifically to the endpoint of the
  Docker Swarm Cluster's Master Node, including the protocol to communicate with
  it and the port used by Docker (e.g. tcp://192.168.99.100:2376)
- The cert.pem file to access the Cluster
- The ca.pem file to access the Cluster
- The key.pem file to access the Cluster

If filled in correctly, clicking "Register Cluster" will bring the user back to
the Clusters Overview page, where the new Cluster is registered and ready to be
deployed on.

## Registering a Service

Once a Cluster is registered, the user can start registering Services on it.
From the Project overview page, clicking on Services will bring up the list of
currently registered Services, which should be empty to start. Clicking on
Register Service will bring up the Service registration form.

![cluster registration page](../images/register_service.png)

The form has to be filled as such:

- The name of the Service
- Whether the Service is going to be managed or unmanaged. Managed Services are
  deployed and managed from MasterMind itself, while unmanaged Services are
  already deployed on the Cluster, and thus only need to be registered.
- The Cluster the Service will be deployed onto. The dropdown menu will
  automatically display the Clusters registered to the Project. This option is
  only present if the Service is meant to be managed.
- The endpoint of the Service. This is the URI the Service can be reached at.
  This option is only present for unmanaged Services.
- The Service Type for this new Service. The Types provided come from the
  Catalog of IoT Services MasterMind can register for the user.
- The Configuration Variables for the Service. Depending on the Service Type,
  a series of extra options will be given for the user to fill in. These can be
  marked as either required or optional, and can come in the form of either
  fields to fill in, or other Services registered within the Project, for
  situations involving linking Services together (e.g. an IoT Agent connected
  to a Context Broker). These fields also differ if the Service is meant to
  be managed or unmanaged.

Once all the details are filled in, the user can choose to simply register the
Service, or register it and deploy it on the Cluster immediately if the Service
is managed. If the Service isn't deployed right away, the user can deploy it
manually from the Service details page, which can be accessed by clicking on the
Service's name from the list of Services.

## Registering NGSI Subscriptions

Assuming the user has a Cluster registered with a Context Broker deployed
(e.g. Orion), it can now start registering NGSI Subscriptions to the Broker.
The Subscriptions list can be accessed from the Project Overview. Clicking on
Register Subscription will bring up the Subscription registration form.

The form can be filled in as such:

- The name for the Subscription
- A description for the Subscription
- The expiration for the Subscription, written in ISO 8601 format
  (e.g. 2019-11-06T14:08:40+00:00)
- The throttling of the Subscription in seconds
- The entities the Subscription is for, id and type (e.g. id: Room1, type: Room)
- The condition attributes for the Subscription (e.g. pressure,
  temperature, ...)
- The Service to register the Subscription to. The dropdown menu displays
  the Services registered to the Project
- The Service to act as the notification endpoint. The dropdown menu displays
  the Services registered to this Project

After registering the Subscription its status is set to inactive by default, as
seen on the Subscriptions list. It can then be selected and activated, as well
as deactivated, by the user via the buttons below.
Clicking on a Subscription's name on the list will take the user to the
Subscription's details page.

## Registering Actors to the Project

In order to allow more than just the one user who created the Project to perform
actions within it, Actors need to be registered within the Project and given
Roles.

From the Project Overview page, clicking on Actors will bring up the Project
Actors list.

![actors management page](../images/actors.png)

The currently logged in User will already have the role of Admin
by default, which means it has full control over the Project and its registered
resources. Clicking on "Add Actor" will allow the user to add in other users to
the Project, and assign a Role to them depending on the degree of control they
should have over the Project.
