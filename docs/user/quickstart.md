Docker
------

The simplest way to get MasterMind up and running is via Docker, using the docker-compose.yml file provided on Github. To deploy MasterMind, navigate to the folder containing the compose file and type:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will run the UI on port 8080, and the API on port 3000 by default.
