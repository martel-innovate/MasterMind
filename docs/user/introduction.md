# Introduction

This section provides an in depth guide on the usage of MasterMind, showcasing
how to create projects, assign user roles, register clusters, register or deploy
services, and register NGSI subscriptions.

MasterMind is made out of two main components: the UI, and the API. The average
user only needs to interact with the UI to make use of most of MasterMind's
features, but MasterMind can be used via API calls if needed. The manual covers
both UI usage as well as the API.
