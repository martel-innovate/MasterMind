# MasterMind Service Manager

## Introduction

The Mastermind Service Manager is a microservice that is in charge of the
deployment of Docker [stacks](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part5/#prerequisites)
to remote Docker Swarm clusters. It comprises of a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
generated  API for receiving incoming requests and a custom made Python Docker
library that leverages [docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and [pyyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) in order to read and parse a
docker-compose file, verify if there is any missing Docker component
(e.g. Volumes and Networks) and deploy the services described in the
docker-compose file on the target engine.

This is an internal component in the MasterMind architecture and as such it is
not visible to end users of Mastermind. More specifically, a user must send a
request to MasterMind API which then will be forwarded to the Service Manager.
This component is described in detail here as it may be of use in other cases;
the docker-engine API does not provide functionality required to deploy a
stack - that was the reason this component was developed.

### High-level architecture

![image alt text](../images/service_manager_architecture.png)

The picture above depicts the high-level architecture of the MasterMind Service
Manager which is comprised of three major components - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/),
[Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) and the [Service Manager](https://github.com/icclab/MasterMind-ServiceManager).
As mentioned above the Service manager comprises of a Swagger API for receiving
incoming requests, this API is based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
micro-framework which handles one request at a time, and by leveraging Nginx
and Gunicorn the overall performance of the service is increased to allow
multiple requests to be served at a time.

## Currently supported API endpoints - MasterMind Service Manager

* `POST /v1/stack` - Create a new stack deploying services, creating networks,
  volumes, secrets and configs defined in the docker-compose file.

* `POST /v1/stack/{name}` - Return the status of an existing stack with the
  services currently running in the Stack and the total amount of replicas.

* `POST /v1/stack/delete/{name}` - Delete the stack removing services and
  networks. Note that volumes, secrets and configs are not deleted.

* `POST /v1/swarm` - Returns the status of managers and workers of the Swarm.

The above image depicts a `POST` request to the `/v1/stack` endpoint. A set of
parameters are given as strings plus a key-value mapping JSON object for this
endpoint:

* **name:** Name of the stack - this is equivalent to the stack_name parameter
  used in a [docker stack deploy command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/#deploy-the-stack-to-the-swarm);

* **compose-file:** A string containing the entire docker-compose file in yaml
  format; Variables may be referenced in this file which are obtained from
  compose-vars; The syntax used for variable substitution is analogous to
  docker-compose, i.e. `${VARIABLE}`, however default values are not currently
  supported, i.e. `${VARIABLE:-default}`.

* **compose-vars:** Also a string in yaml format containing the key-value
  mapping of the variables previously defined (i.e. key: value).

* **engine-url:** Swarm manager docker engine url. For example:
  `tcp://swarmmanager.zurich.fiwarelab.org:2376`

* **ca-cert:** A string containing the ca.pem certificate protecting the
  docker-engine.

* **cert:**  A string containing the cert.pem certificate protecting the
  docker-engine.

* **cert-key:** A string containing the key.pem certificate protecting the
  docker-engine.

* **external-files:** An array of JSON objects containing all external files
  required by the compose-file, .i.e secrets and configs. The JSON object
  syntax should be `{‘filename’: ‘file_content’}`.

If using [Rancher](http://rancher.com/) the IP address of the Swarm manager
can be found in the interface under the tab
Infrastructure -> Hosts (More details below).
Note that a swarm may have more than one manager: in this case, any of the swarm
managers could be chosen. The default port used by Docker engine is 2376 and
this is the port usually used in the engine-url parameter. *Note that
responsibility for ensuring this port is open on the VM lies with the user -
it may require specifically setting up security groups and/or other firewall
rules to ensure these ports are accessible*.
The Swagger UI for the API specs is served by the Service Manager at
<http://MANAGER_HOST:MANAGER_PORT/v1/ui>

## Security

In order to safely connect to a remote Docker engine, the Mastermind Service
Manager requires TLS certificates to protect the connection to the remote
Docker engine. [This is a common practice in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/).

For example, [Rancher](http://rancher.com/) makes use of docker-machine which
automatically generates certificates and protects the engine for every host
created - note that this does not apply for custom hosts, i.e. hosts which are
not created using docker-machine.

All certificates can be easily retrieved from Rancher’s UI, in the
Infrastructure -> Hosts page select the host which has the label
`swarm=manager` and at the top right section there is a button to edit the
Host, click on it then click on `Machine Config`. This will download a zip file
containing all certificates and keys that can be used to access the host.

## Docker Compose Reference - Parameters Supported by the Service Manager

The Docker compose file format is quite complex, reflecting the complexity of
container systems. The Mastermind Service Manager does not currently support
all parameters defined in docker-compose. Below, the set of supported
parameters is provided.

### Services

* command:
  Either an array or a string. For example: "command param1 param2"
  or ["command", “param1”, “param2”]
* configs:
  Either the short or the long syntax are supported.
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#configs').
* deploy[labels]:
  A JSON object containing the labels for the service.
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#labels-1').
* deploy[mode]:
  Networking mode to be associated to the service. Either `global` or
  `replicated` as defined in the docker-compose reference documentation.
* deploy[placements]:
  An array of constraints for deploying the service.
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#placement').
* deploy[replicas]:
  Amount of containers that should be running for the service.
  If enabled this option will set the mode to replicated.

  Override the default entrypoint.
* environment:
  An array of strings containing environment variables for the service.
  Key-value mapping format currently not supported.
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#environment').
* healthcheck:
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#healthcheck').
* image:
  Specify the image to start the container from. A repository/tag name.
* labels:
  Labels to be associated with the container of the service.
  It can be either an array or a key-value mapping JSON object.
* networks:
  Array of network names to be associated to the service.
* ports:
  Array of strings, currently supported syntax: "8000:8000"
* secrets:
  Either the short or the long syntax are supported.
  [For more information click here]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#secrets').
* volumes:
  Array of volumes to be attached to the service.
  Could have the following syntax: - “volume_name”, -
  "volume_name:/path/to/file", - “volume_name:/path/to/file:ro”

### Networks and Volumes

* driver:
  Defaults to ‘local’ for volumes and ‘overlay’ for networks.
* driver_opts:
  A key-value mapping of options for the driver.
* external:
  If set to true, specifies that this volume has been created outside of
  Compose and therefore won’t be created by the service manager.
  Raises an exception in case the volume or network does not exist.
* labels:
  Labels to be associated to the volume or network.
  It can be either an array or a key-value mapping JSON object.

### Secrets and Configs

* file:
  Name of the file used to create the secret or config.
  The service manager will check the ‘external_files’ parameter and get
  the file content.

## Known issues

There is a known bug in newer versions of Docker engine preventing the
deployment of stacks to a Swarm cluster. The stack will be deployed but no
actual containers will start, hanging on ‘Pending’ status. For more information
about the bug please visit [#35093](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35093)
and [#2396](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/2396).
