Registering new Actors
----------------------

In MasterMind, Actors represent either Fiware Lab Users or Organizations. MasterMind automatically
creates a new Actor whenever a new User or Organization successfully authenticate on Fiware Lab when logging in for the first time, obtaining full name and email address from the lab as well. By default, the new Actor doesn't have any Role within MasterMind, and thus has no access to any existing Project. In order to be granted permission to view or alter a Project the Actor needs to be assigned a Role within the Project.
