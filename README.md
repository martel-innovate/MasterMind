# MasterMind

## Introduction

MasterMind is a management platform for FIWARE Data and IoT services, such as Context Brokers, IoT Agents, IoT Managers and so forth. It allows users to create individual projects with defined permissions per user, register Docker Swarm clusters to them in order to deploy or register IoT services, as well as registering and managing NSGI subscriptions.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to get MasterMind up and running is via Docker, using the `docker-compose.yml` file provided. To deploy MasterMind, navigate to the folder containing the compose file and type:

```
docker-compose up
```

MasterMind's UI can be found on port 8080 by default.
